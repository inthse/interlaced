# Interlaced Translations
a simple webpage that splits text into sentences for manual translation

## Who is it for?
I designed this for myself and other language learners who are practicing their written translation skills.

## How is it used?
1. Paste any text (such as articles from the news, Wikipedia, etc.) into the first text box (top left).
2. Click anywhere outside the text area or press tab, and below you'll see your text split into sentences.
3. Click the area below a sentence or press tab to begin typing your own translation there.
4. When you click or tab away from each translation area, everything you've typed so far will appear in the top right text box in case you want to copy your entire translation to use elsewhere.
5. **Caution:** You will lose your work if you refresh the page, or if your browser automatically refreshes it.
